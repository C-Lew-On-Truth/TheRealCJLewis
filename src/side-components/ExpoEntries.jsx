                <h1>Professional Foundation</h1>
        My foundation as a Media Technology Professional started out as
        Format DJ at WNBY 91.3 FM. This happened to be the campus radio station
        at Buffalo State College. It was my first chance at creatively expressing myself
        in a professional radio studio where I had to operate an audio board,
        follow on-air protocol, and show on-air listeners my smooth personality splashed
        with my authentic musical taste! After a few more years I was able to secure an
        internship at the local TV News station WIVB News Channel 4! I was able to apply
        my educational training in corparate news environment which required wearing
        many hats such as learning how to be producer, shooter, and editor in a limited
        amount of time! I knew what to expect and what was expected of me when stepping
        into any media environment. I was able to secure my degree in Media Productions
        in 2014 while also participating as four year NCAA Student Athlete on the Mens Hockey Team!
