            My foundation as a Media Technology Professional started out as
            Format DJ at WNBY 91.3 FM. This happened to be the campus radio station
            at Buffalo State College. It was my first chance at creatively expressing myself
            in a professional radio studio where I had to operate an audio board,
            follow on-air protocol, and show on-air listeners my smooth personality splashed
            with my authentic musical taste! After a few more years I was able to secure an
            internship at the local TV News station WIVB News Channel 4! There, I was able to apply
            my educational training in a corparate news environment which required wearing
            many hats. Such as learning how to be producer, shooter, and editor in a limited
            amount of time! I knew what to expect and what was required of me when stepping
            into any media environment. I was able to secure my degree in Media Productions
            in 2014 while also participating as four year NCAA Student Athlete on the Mens Hockey Team!

            After graduating I spent a year in Buffalo working as a full time Line Cook and doing
            PA work on the side for a private Cinematographer named Jim Panzarella. However, the Buffalo
            metro area did not offer a whole lot of media opportunities so I decided to relocate to New York
            City to apply my degree into securing a full time job. After 6 months of volunteer PA work while
            working as a Line Cook to make a living, I finally earned a position working at The National Hockey League
            as Digital Asset Archivist! This position gave me a different perspective in the industry
            on how media was preserved, organized, and digitized. In addition, I would learn how to be resourceful
            and begin to develop technical skills which I discovered was just as necessary as being creative! From
            The National Hockey League, I would take on an operational role working at Adobe Stock Media! Here, I would gain a
            deeper perspective in photography and videos, along with acting as a troubleshooter for myself
            and provide assistance for my fellow colleagues!

            Working at Adobe gave me a knowledgable foundation on how software systems work along
            with the importance of media formats for video and images. I was also introduced to the world
            of web software development specifically with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! To this day I
            continue to build on my knowledge of these programming languages! Unfortunately, I would go
            on to leave Adobe and take a job at Meredith working as Video Ingest Technician.
            This experience, taught me how to truly manage media particularly, the different transcoding methods,
            various video codecs, and the management of data space! My time at Meredith would not last long,
            as I would decide to take a Full Time Staff Position at New York One News!
            As a current member of the Technical Operations department,
            my responsibilities consist of quality control, media management, and technical troubleshooting!
            Being at New York One has been a pleasure, but I know that my journey is not complete!
